# Cloud Goes Frazier

**Cloud Goes Frazier** is my personal technical site and public lab.

It’s where I build and document projects that extend my professional work in
cloud infrastructure, automation, Kubernetes, GPU platforms, and AI tooling.

The site is intentionally simple and focused on execution over polish.
